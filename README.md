## Lab Questions

### Compare and contrast One Hot and Binary encodings

The diffence between the one hot and the binary iis the implementation of D flip Flops for each state for the hot shot, if the same  pattern were tranfered to binary it would need two Dflipflops per state instead in binary we "divide" up or bits into three seprate K-maps simplifying more complicated encodings.

### Which method did your team find easier, and why?

one hot was eaisier method for us, it was overall more intuiative and eaiser to follow thhe steps for our encoding.

### In what conditions would you have to use one over the other? Think about resource utilization on the FPGA.

In senerios with less sattes it would be better to use the one hot but the more states there are the more bennifits there are to use binary.
